## 💡 Key Features

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
  Processed large datasets using Python (Pandas) to handle missing values, fix data types, and transform raw data for analysis.

- 🗃️ **Complex SQL Queries**  
  Developed advanced SQL queries to join multiple tables, aggregate transaction data, and extract relevant metrics.

- 📈 **Time-Series Analysis**  
  Identified seasonal trends and changes in customer transaction behavior over time to reveal usage patterns.

- 🌍 **Geospatial Mapping**  
  Mapped transaction volumes across regions to visualize geographic distribution and detect regional differences.

- 📊 **Power BI Dashboards**  
  Built interactive dashboards to visualize trends, monitor transaction types, and flag anomalies such as unusually large transactions for fraud detection.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Import raw transaction datasets and perform cleaning with Python (Pandas).  
2. Use SQL queries to join and aggregate data across customers, transaction types, and regions.  
3. Conduct time-based trend analysis to observe seasonal or periodic changes.  
4. Map geospatial data to visualize transaction distribution by region.  
5. Create interactive dashboards in Power BI to track key metrics and detect anomalies.
