<h1>Bank Transaction Data Analysis Project</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
  The goal of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of bank transaction data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights related to customer behavior, transaction types, channels, and geographic distribution. The focus was not limited to detecting anomalies, but aimed at providing a broad understanding of transaction activities across multiple dimensions.
</p>

<h2>Project Workflow</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Python:</strong> Cleaned and pre-processed raw transaction data, handled missing values, and prepared datasets for analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL:</strong> Performed deeper data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation using SQL queries. Joined datasets to combine transactional and channel-level information for richer analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Excel:</strong> Organized, validated, and reshaped data for easier import into visualization tools. Conducted preliminary pivot table exploration.</li>
  <li><strong>Power BI:</strong> Created dynamic dashboards and interactive visuals to showcase transaction trends across transaction types, channels, years, and geographical locations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Highlights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Identified the most commonly used transaction types and channels.</li>
  <li>Analyzed transaction amounts over different years to detect changes in customer behavior.</li>
  <li>Explored the geographic distribution of transactions to understand regional trends.</li>
  <li>Flagged unusually large transactions by comparing individual transactions to channel averages.</li>
  <li>Built visualizations to present actionable insights for potential business strategies and operational improvements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools & Technologies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python (Pandas, NumPy)</li>
  <li>SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Filtering)</li>
  <li>Excel (Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables)</li>
  <li>Power BI (Interactive Reports and Dashboards)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>
  The project successfully delivered a multi-dimensional view of bank transactions, helping to identify key usage patterns, channel preferences, geographic behaviors, and potential outliers. These insights can support decision-making processes for improving customer services, detecting anomalies, and developing strategic financial products.
